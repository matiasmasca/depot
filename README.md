# README
This is just the implementation of the code of the book Agile Web Development with Rails 7.2 that I have the opportunity to purchased after I had read a ilegal copy some years ago with Rails 3.2

- Rails version: 7.2.1
- Rack version: 3.1.7
- Ruby version: ruby 3.3.2 (2024-05-30 revision e5a195edf6) +YJIT [x86_64-linux]



This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
